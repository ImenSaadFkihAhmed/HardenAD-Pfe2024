function New-LocalAdminGroup {

        .SYNOPSIS
         The <New-LocalAdminGroup> function updates the existing groups (in case a T0 becomes a T2 for example).
         Then it creates the missing groups.
        .DESCRIPTION
         The function scans all the computers in the domain, and checks:
            - A group exists for this computer :
                - If yes, the script checks that it is in the right tier.
                - If not, the script creates the group in the right tier.
         If a group is not in the right tier, it is moved to the inactive OU corresponding to its tier and 
         a new group is created, this time in the correct tier.

         This script is private and cannot be used outside the module.
